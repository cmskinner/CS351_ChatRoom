## What is this?
This was an assignment my professor gave my friend Alex and I to understand and expand slightly. The code given to us was very clean and written by Thomas Otero. Our goal was to understand this code and create a visual interface for a user as well as give a presentation on the assignment to our Design of Large Problems class.
